What is an Incident Postmortem?


A postmortem (or post-mortem) is a process intended to help you learn from past incidents. It typically involves an analysis or discussion soon after an event has taken place.

Postmortems typically involve blame-free analysis and discussion soon after an incident or event has taken place. An artifact is produced that includes a detailed description of exactly what went wrong in order to cause the incident, along with a list of steps to take in order to prevent a similar incident from occurring again in the future. An analysis of how your incident response process itself worked during the incident should also be included in the discussion. The value of postmortems comes from helping institutionalize a culture of continuous improvement. This way, teams are better prepared when another incident inevitably occurs with mission- or business-critical systems.

The importance of an incident postmortem process


1. Bringing people together to engage in a structured, collaborative process allows everyone to contribute what they learned and can build trust and resiliency within your team. And documenting the incident and how the team remedied it can inform how future incidents are handled. 

2. You may also decide to publish takeaways from your incident postmortem with customers or the rest of your organization. This can go a long way in rebuilding confidence in people who may not have been closely involved as the incident was happening. Other teams in your organization, especially leadership, may need to see the details of the problem and what steps were taken to resolve it to head off any second-guessing of your team in the future. 

3. Partners, customers, and end-users may also want to know what happened and what steps you have taken to improve their experience. Making your incident postmortem available on your public-facing website may not be appropriate in all cases, but your marketing or public relations team can help you craft the language so people get the information in a way that is informative and builds trust in your services.
